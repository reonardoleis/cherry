Cherry is a minimalist reactive framework for building frontends in [Go](https://go.dev/). Inspired by React and leveraging the power of WebAssembly (WASM), Cherry allows you to create highly interactive and efficient web applications with Go. While still a work in progress, Cherry aims to combine the simplicity and productivity of modern frontend development with the performance benefits of Go. If you're looking for a fresh approach to frontend development in Go, keep an eye on Cherry as it evolves.
